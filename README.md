# CSE 163 - Data Programming - Final Project


1.	Across the United States, the low-income suffer from food insecurity, which is characterized by being unable to access healthy, nutritious food in a convenient way. In this project, we would like to visualize the various indicators for food insecurity on a map in order to understand if there are any underlying spatial components to the issue i.e. is food insecurity concentrated in certain areas? Are there certain indicators of food insecurity that vary more dramatically than others?
2.	Once we have established what food insecurity in the US looks like in question 1, we want to explore the larger question of the cost burden of poverty - specifically, does the food insecurity that arises from poverty contribute to negative healthcare outcomes and high healthcare costs? We will attempt to answer this question by utilizing additional data visualizations that will help illustrate whether high instances of food insecurity contribute to higher healthcare costs across the 50 states.
